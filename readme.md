##Design

• We want to be able to generate random Hereos.

• The user gets to put in their class of hereo on generation
    • classes: Mage, Healer, Barbarian
    • Class will not influence stats created, therefore getting an epic hero will be hard.

• I want to be paid... 0.05 eth per hero!

• I should be able to get my heroes I have generated.

• Heroes should be stored on the chain.

• stats are strength, health, intellect, magic, dexterity

• stats are randomly generated
    • A scale of 1 - 18
    • The stats are randomly picked and their amplitude is randomly determined according to the
    following:
        • Stat 1 can max at 18
        • Stat 2 can max at 171
        • Stat 3 can max at 16
        • ....

• You could imagine these being an NFT

• They are non divisable
